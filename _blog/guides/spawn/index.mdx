## Story

The plot centers on CIA operative Albert "Al" Simmons, who is killed while performing his job and comes back to life as the demonic vigilante known as Spawn five years later.
Another extraterrestial creature appears as a bizarre assailant stalks the city, ripping out people's hearts.
Our wounded hero recalls that he made a pact with the devil to get back to his loving wife as his head reels.

### Early life

Al Simmons was the second of three brothers (Marc, Al, and Richard) born to Esther and Bernard Simmons in Detroit, Michigan. Simmons was a talented officer in the United States Marine Corps, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He eventually joined the Secret Service of the United States, which led to his transfer to the Central Intelligence Agency. Director Jason Wynn recruited Simmons into the CIA's top-secret covert ops division known as the US Security Group, an elite task force having jurisdiction in all domestic and foreign crises.

Director Wynn and Simmons began butting heads more frequently, and Simmons announced his intention to retire.

Simmons was murdered on the orders of Director Wynn on a mission in Botswana for the USSG's Operation Knightstrike by fellow mercenary Bruce Stinson, nicknamed Chapel (later retcon to be fellow mercenary Jessica Priesl). Because of his life as an assassin, Simmons was banished to Hell. Simmons agrees to become a Hellspawn in exchange for one last chance to see his wife Wanda Blake after striking a bargain with the creature known as Malebolgia.

### Getting Back to Earth

Al Simmons, now a Hellspawn, is returned to the earth by Malebolgia, but with little memory, a horribly scarred body, restricted but seemingly limitless magical powers, and a monitor, the Clown, AKA Violator. Simmons gradually discovers that it has been five years. When he chooses to pay his "one final visit" to his ex-wife, Wanda Blake, he discovers that she has married his best buddy, Terry Fitzgerald, and the two have a daughter, Cyan. Al shapeshifts his body, but chooses to assume Terry's form and make love to her. She becomes pregnant, triggering a prophecy of the child that will determine the course of reality.

Al, who is now known as Spawn, embarks on his first few anti-heroic adventures, taking on street gangs, organized crime, and their enforcer Overtkill, as well as Billy Kincaid, a child molester and murderer. The most memorable encounter in Spawn's early escapades was with Dave Sim's Cerebus the Aardvark. Spawn meets the Redeemer and Anti-Spawn, who Al discovers is actually Jason Wynn (a God-fearing man transformed in a similar fashion as Wynn). Angela, an angel whose job it is to hunt Hellspawn for amusement in Heaven, attacks him, but he survives and she takes the Medieval Spawn as one of her spoils. As this is happening, he seizes control of the alleys that make up "Rat City," where he makes friends with the homeless people and emerges as their protector. One old slob named Cogliostro in particular seems to know a lot about him. Al is guided by Cogliostro and the Clown, who each try to persuade him to use his abilities for good and evil, respectively. The Clown demonstrates his ability to change into the Demon known as the Violator, which is his true form. Also, after Bobby is killed by Chapel, Spawn revives him. Spawn runs into Batman in a spin-off issue, who then fires a bat shuriken at him, splitting Al's face in two. Spawn turns to his devoted friend Bobby, who instead ties it shut with a shoe lace, despite the fact that he has limited energy that he could use to cure. Terry Fitzgerald would eventually take off this shoelace, and Terry's daughter Cyan Fitzgerald would later wear it as a necklace. Spawn's "shoestring face" would continue to be one of the character's most recognizable features.

### The Initial Metamorphosis

After escaping Heaven and fighting a small sect of the KKK, he made his way back to New York, where he met the second Redeemer, who proceeded to kidnap a friend and easily defeat Spawn. Moments later, his costume (which was nothing more than a pile of rags at this point) went crazy, nearly killing Bootsie and others around him, then went lifeless for hours. Then, in an explosion of necroplasm, he was transformed into Black and White, his right leg and left arm heavily armored. His suit could shapeshift to a much greater extent in this version. During their second encounter, the costume transformed into a blade and severed Redeemer's hand.

Spawn meets the Freak after his encounter with the Redeemer, and during the "Bloodfeud" storyline, nightmares begin to torture the former military assassin from a first-person perspective. Other beings are hunted and consumed by a creature that appears to be similar to Spawn. When Spawn awakens, he finds himself in the midst of several dead people. He claims that after his suit metamorphoses, it feeds on blood like a vampire, but after his first battle with John Sansker, aka Jean Sans-Coeur, "Heartless John" (a vampire and the true reason for the messes that Spawn finds himself in) and after he stripped himself of his suit, he argues with the Clown about the latter. He tells Spawn that his costume feeds on souls, and after Spawn made peace with his state, he re-bonded with his suit and drove Jean out of Rat City in a fierce battle.

### Hell and Heaven

Spawn struggled to find a way to break free from Hell's grip and reclaim his humanity. Attacks from both Heaven and Hell were becoming more frequent, and Spawn was on the verge of succumbing to the violence and evil. The Heap, an emissary of the Purgatory, a power equal to Heaven and Hell that Spawn had never encountered before, brought salvation in the form of a mound of festering garbage. They bestowed upon him a slew of new abilities that would enable him to triumph over the worst that Heaven and Hell had to offer.

While these abilities are not explicitly stated, they appear to grant Spawn control over all elements and other aspects of nature. It was explained to him that the Purgatory did not like the war between Heaven and Hell, but was becoming increasingly agitated by the destruction it caused. They inflicted the Gazer's (the planet's) pains on him, and when he returned, Spawn became "aware" of the world. Other than listening to the Gazer, Spawn did not use his powers until he was impaled on the pole of a large sign by the dark god Urizen. After the Purgatory bestowed Urizen with a "gift," which Spawn uses to imprison Urizen after recovering thanks to Angela, Urizen began causing havoc on the planet. Urizen is imprisoned inside the Gazer after Spawn cracks open the ground.

After killing Urizen, Spawn discovers that Malebolgia was behind the emergence of the demonic god as part of a complex plan to seize complete control of all the realms of Hell. Malebolgia's power is at an all-time low after a stunning failure. Although Angela's life is lost in the process, Spawn is ultimately successful in killing his demon lord by going back to Hell with the aid of Angela. Spawn rejects both Malebolgia's crown and an invitation to enter Heaven despite the evil Mammon's offer. Instead, Spawn concentrates his energies on stopping human suffering and eliminating the evil that resides on Gazer.

As a result of the darkness on Gazer, Spawn approaches his former instructor Cogliostro with a fresh strategy. He will assume the crown of Hell and then remodel it, transforming it from a sinister underworld into a brand-new paradise that will wash away all the Gazer's grief and melancholy. When Spawn and Cogliostro encounter Redeemer III, some Scorpion demons bring him to Hell during the ensuing battle. Cogliostro receives a package from Mammon before killing himself and entering Hell with the box. Spawn receives it from him, opens it, and he and his wife catch a brief glimpse of a utopia. Cogliostro then reveals that he is the biblical Cain, the first killer, and claims the crown of Hell for himself. Cain utilizes his newly discovered strength to deliver Spawn to Gazer still alive and in Al Simmons' body, but without the symbiote of the Hellspawn.

### Armageddon

Spawn's memories are restored thanks to the Greenworld's power. His suit evolves once more and appears to be one with his body, but as time passes, he begins to despise himself. He has been rejected by both Heaven and Hell, and he now lives in an abandoned warehouse with maggots and other insects crawling inside his body. He returns to the Dead Zone, despite the fact that a Hellspawn is not welcome there. Spawn is immediately confronted by the Disciple, who tears his brain out, throws his heart into the Greenworld, and casts Spawn's body into Hell. Mammon kidnaps and tortures Spawn in order to learn his secrets.

A soul is liberated when Spawn's heart falls to the Greenworld. Chris reunites with his mother and travels to Hell with Sam Burke and Twitch Williams in order to save Spawn from Mammon. Spawn flees to Earth, where signs of Armageddon begin to appear, and searches for a way to stop it. Spawn discovers that Wanda's twin children are to blame. He prevents them from murdering their entire family, but he cannot destroy them. Zera explains that Jake is God and Katie is Satan.

Spawn discovers that the Mother took away their powers and positions and banished them to Earth due to their hatred for one another and constant fighting. She tells him that while he cannot prevent Armageddon, he has the potential to become a god and save the human race.

To gain such power, he must consume a piece of Forbidden Fruit from the Garden of Eden. She informs Spawn that he must fight The Disciple. It is revealed that there are 12 Disciples, each representing one of Jesus' disciples. Spawn's power is also weakened because demons are not permitted to enter the Garden, but with Cyan's guidance, he defeats all but one of the Disciples, except Judas, whom Cyan instructs him not to kill. Judas then stabs Cyan in the heart, but the Mother saves him by giving him a piece of the fruit. He transforms into an angel and gains greater power.

Spawn returns to Earth, which has been destroyed by the Four Horsemen, while angels and demons prepare for the final battle. After defeating Zera, Spawn discovers the bodies of Heaven's warriors, one of whom is Granny Blake, who is betrayed by her faith. Spawn fights Satan and God, and destroys the forces of Heaven, Hell, and humanity. He is then killed by the two, who fight on Earth alone.

Spawn reappears and resurrects everyone who knows what happened. He abandons God and Satan to their respective battles and closes the gates to Heaven, Hell, and Earth. He requests that the Mother turn him into a human, but later requests that he be turned back into a Hellspawn after remembering that, prior to his first death as Al Simmons, he had beaten Wanda and caused her to miscarry their child so he could focus on his "work," leading him to conclude that he has always been a monster and does not deserve to try to be human again.

### Return to the mortal realm

#### New Clown

Spawn discovers the Clown has returned, possessing the body of a man named Barney Saunders, who is having an affair with a woman named Wilma Barbara. Spawn both destroys and rebuilds the world. The Clown saves Saunders so he can use his body. He then awoke the dark urges within the tenants of an apartment building and used them to construct a portal to Hell in order to resurrect his brothers. However, Wilma appeared before he could create a portal, and his love for her allowed Saunders to regain control. He then intended to close the portal by passing through it, but Wilma accompanied him because he was upset about her abandoning him in the chute.

Zera reappears in the form of a head in a jar. Mambo Suzanne, a voodoo priestess, summons Spawn. Zera fights Spawn and tries to take over Nyx's body, but she is killed when Suzanne throws Zera's head into the street. Nyx is set free, and she and Spawn rekindle their friendship.

Ab and Zab construct a hell in which visitors are forced to confront their deepest fears, which are devoured by demons known as sin-eaters. Spawn is confronted with his own sin against Wanda and his unborn child when he confronts Ab and Zab. Spawn is trapped by guilt and is parasitized by a sin eater. When Nyx intervenes, he breaks the illusion of the sin eater. Spawn destroys everyone's illusions and meets Albert Simmons' brother Richard.

Spawn decides to let Richard feel the consequences of his sins. As Mr. Malefick, Mammon had an impact on Albert and Richard Simmons. Only Marc Simmons was able to save himself from Mammon and help the others. Instead of calling an ambulance, Richard summons his brothers to assist him in saving the drug dealer's life, and Albert Simmons pulls the knife from Weasel's body and kills him with it. Mammon appears and sends the brothers home while he hides the body of the drug dealer.

Nyx and Spawn kill the last sin eater, and Spawn discovers Richard is unable to recall their parents due to a Mammon-placed spell; Spawn goes to find out more about them. He discovers their home under Mammon's spell. His mother conspired with Mammon to create a Hellspawn that was more powerful than the others. His father then hands him a journal, which reveals that his ancestor encountered a Hellspawn known as the Gunslinger Spawn in the past.

### Spawn at his prime

Due to Erskine's mental abilities, Spawn is rendered defenseless and outmatched, and he is worried by Erskine's invention of a tentacle creature he employs to impale opponents.

Spawn is given the opportunity to kill Erskine. If Erskine does not reveal the location of Mammon, Spawn enters the bubble dome, a dimension. Erskine is allowed to complete his final murder by Mammon. Mammon admits that he was the one who taught Erskine how to use his abilities. Erskine contemplates suicide. Spawn is still attacking Mammon.

Later, in a mortuary, a man awakens with amnesia. Some doctors who are treating him discover he is alive and are killed by a man in a robe, who is revealed to be Morana. The resurrected man, Severin, belongs to a vampire species known as the Vrykolakas. He wishes to die, and Morana promises him death in exchange for his assistance. Severin appears and defeats Marc and Nyx before biting Spawn to transfer his vampirism. He withdraws to Morana.

Cyan has been having terrifying visions. Spawn is fighting the suit in his mind as a result of Severin's attack. Mammon, Morana, and his adopted mother and father plan the next step in their journey. Cyan is experiencing more visions. Granny had warned Cyan, so she uses a knife to send Spawn into an illusionary world to talk to Wanda in a nonviolent manner.

#### Morana

Spawn converses with Wanda there. She claims she cannot forgive Al for their child's death, but she still loves the man inside him. Spawn tries to take out Cyan's knife but is stopped by the suit. K7-Leetha appears and takes over Nyx, followed by Cyan and Nyx. Nyx, now controlled by the K7, attempts to murder Cyan and Wanda but is stopped by Mammon. The entire group travels to a castle, where Mammon reveals his plan for creating the perfect Hellspawn. He wants the Rapture to happen so that Satan, God, and Malebolgia will all be gone, and then revealed that his ideal Hellspawn was Al and Wanda's miscarried child, Morana.

Morana bonds with the uniform after washing herself in virgin's blood and prepares to consume her parents' souls. Cyan summons her powers and travels to the future. She converses with an elderly woman who leaves her a message for Al. When she returns, she orders Spawn to summon the Legion's final twelve members, who are defeated by Morana. Mammon mocks Al and rejects Morana. Cyan tells Nyx about a spell that will trap Mammon and Morana. It works; both demons are sealed away, and the others are returned to their homes. Al enters another dimension, where he is reborn as a weapon against both heaven and hell.

#### Endgame

Spawn is on the verge of entering the human dimension. He walks down the alleys and blows off his head. Meanwhile, Jim Downing, an amnesiac recovering in a hospital, awakens. He appears to be acquainted with Spawn. A janitor attempts to profit from Jim's story by contacting a lawyer. The lawyer takes his own life. A thug is hired to kidnap Jim and assault him with a flaming skull. While the thug causes damage to the hospital, Jim flees. The thug pursues Jim, who transforms into Spawn, kills his assailant, and then flees the burning hospital in human form, eventually being taken in by firefighters.

He is transferred to another hospital along with other patients. He later leaves and rejoins his previous nurse Sara, where he begins to transform. He calls Sara, but she runs away before he can see her. Meanwhile, a reporter begins to inquire about the hospital incident. While wandering the city, Jim is attacked and kills his attackers. This catches the attention of Sam and Twitch, who recognize the chaos as the work of Spawn.

Jim wanders off again after reuniting with Sara and telling her about his transformation, and this time he meets Wanda Blake, Al Simmons' ex-wife. She recognizes Jim as the form Al assumed when he first returned to Earth, and she realizes he, too, is a Spawn.

On Wanda's advice, Jim travels to Rat City, where he discovers Spawn's throne and is greeted by an angel. Jim fights the angel, defeats him, and flees. Jim discovers that a man working for Gilbert Sanchez has been questioning him.

Clown later attacks the angel Spawn and removes her wings. When Spawn returns, he is powerless and insane, and he encounters Freak and Violator. Despite Freak's warnings, Clown begins to deceive Jim, telling him his suit is a living being before disappearing. Clown is apprehended by Sam and Twitch and meets with the leader of a vampire group in an attempt to forge a bond between the leader, Clown, and Spawn.

Mob members assassinate Gilbert Sanchez in exchange for information on the new Spawn. Spawn tries to learn more about Jim but is attacked and uses his powers against him. Jim later locates the man who had been questioning Sara. He follows him to his family's home, which is bombed, killing everyone except Spawn inside. Spawn tracks down more mob members, interrogates them further, and then murders them.

#### Resurrection

Spawn is revived in Resurrection and later told by God in dog form that Wanda has died and is now trapped in Hell, where Al must rescue her. He defeats Satan and rescues his wife. Because the Man of Miracles is sold to Marvel and retconned out of existence, God and Satan are no longer twins, and God and Satan are based on the Abrahamic story of Creation. After saving Wanda from Satan, she ascends to Heaven, and Spawn continues to protect the people in Wanda's memory from both Heaven and Hell, as well as any supernatural threats.

## Powers and abilities

Spawn's body is dense, weighing over 450 pounds, and is entirely made of necroplasm. This grants him superhuman strength, speed, and endurance. While he still has internal organs, they are only partially functional, and their damage or destruction has no effect on Spawn. When he regenerates his wounds, these organs magically reappear. This could be due to Spawn's inability to let go of his human self, as he keeps his human organs despite the fact that he no longer needs them.

Spawn is a master of hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, having received decades of military training and being a well-known and experienced street fighter. He's an exceptionally talented acrobat and athlete who, in his early years, showed great potential in someday becoming an olympic athlete, having attained peak physical condition as a regular human, something he still retains after his death. Over the course of his life and career, Spawn has acquired proficiency in thirteen different martial arts, including Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Kung-Fu, Jeet Kune Do, Aikido, Taekwondo, Boxing, Brazilian Jujitsu, Hapkido, Muay Thai, Ninjutsu, and American Karate. He also briefly learned Taekkyeon and was a skilled swordsman and marksman, largely as a result of his time spent in the military. The ten languages that Spawn speaks fluently include: Japanese, Spanish, French, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, Arabic, Persian, and Russian. He is a brilliant man who has a strong interest in travel.

Leetha of the 7th House of K, a live symbiotic garment worn by Spawn (also known as K7-Leetha). The presenter takes on a domineering position over his outfit while wearing it. Spawn will be protected even if he falls asleep thanks to an organism attached to his central nervous system and made up of his shroud, spikes, chains, and skulls.

The necroplasm that feeds on Spawn's body is the true source of the outfit. When Spawn needs it, he may draw this energy back and use it to fuel his powers without depleting his own supply. In addition, the costume has the ability to absorb evil energy from the surrounding environment, including that of people, animals (primarily carrion insects, but also wolves, coyotes, common house cats (though in comics, cats are always black), fictitious giant rodents that resemble rats, bats, red foxes, and mongooses), and even specific urban areas (Detroit, New York City, Los Angeles,and in Spawn: Resurrection, Albuquerque is alluded to). 

As a result of the suit's connection to his nervous system, Simmons is able to change the shape of it, which includes the appearance of spikes, armor plating, or the transformation of the shroud into a fighting axe. The shroud itself is a potent offensive tool with the ability to sever limbs and/or disarm foes with carefully angled prods and pokes during combat.

Spawn is a powerful magical being. Spawn had a finite amount of power, and the reader would be able to see how much by way of a counter that started at 9:9:9:9. The counter depletes after every time Spawn expends his energy. As a result, Simmons mostly uses his costume's inherent powers or weaponry as opposed to its magical ones. Although the power supply is limited, creativity is Spawn's biggest constraint. In an interview with the author, Simmons said that Jesus was the source of his powers. Simmons uses this power in a variety of ways, such as raising the dead, firing necroplasmic energy blasts, teleporting, flame-breathing, transmuting, manipulating the elements, shape-shifting, flying, conversing with animals, reading minds, invisibility, creating portals, manipulating time and souls, warping reality, and regeneration. He also feeds off the evil deeds and negative energy of others to increase his strength and necroplasm counter. Unless they are killed by a weapon of heaven or by magic, Spawn is essentially unkillable. In "The Dead's Zone," a small area of Earth that is Heaven's dominion and in the ethereal realm of the "Greensworld," he is likewise left helpless (and hence mortal).

Phasing, psychic link, superhuman senses, telekinesis, cosmic awareness, and transformation are among Spawn's additional abilities.

Spawn's power level has diminished since the Armageddon narrative, and the majority of the power he still possesses comes from his symbiotic suit.

Simmons is a highly skilled soldier who is equally adept at armed ranged combat as unarmed melee. Because of his training, Spawn prefers to utilize weapons to his magical powers.

Spawn was given the capacity to "feel," "sense," or "be mindful of" suffering, pain, and hatred by The Keeper, an agent of Greensworld's Emerald Parliament, as a gift and a punishment. He is aware, even unconsciously, when someone is injured or killed since he has developed a stronger bond with shadowy beings and feels the suffering of all humanity through them.

Spawn was made up of an unknowable number of lost souls known as Legion who can share his Hellspawn talents. According to Detective Twitch, there may be as many as 6,000 people inside of Spawn, all of which perished during the same hour that Al Simmons was killed. Malebolgia used the power of these souls to make Spawn uncontrollable, and even when the souls ascend to a higher realm, Simmons is able to draw on their wisdom and experiences. These souls can also be made to physically manifest as Hellspawn by Spawn, enabling them to emerge and fight alongside him wherever he is. The Armageddon ordeal drastically decreased the Legion's effective force from 6000 souls to just twelve; nevertheless, because the souls that remained are the strongest and most battle-hardened, the force's strike impact remained mostly unchanged.

Al Simmons is shown to have a symbiotic relationship with the Legion and to experience pain every time one of the Legionnaires is killed. Morana eventually dispatches the last of the Legion, robbing him of the capacity to summon them.
