## Story

### Origin

Spawn was previously Al Simmons, a highly trained assassin who was regarded as the greatest. He was a well-known soldier who had achieved his greatest success when he saved the President from an assassination attempt. He was promoted to a higher level of the C.I.A., where he dealt with information that the government had kept hidden from the general public. However, Al quickly understood that the government was not always perfect and began to wonder if their acts were genuinely correct. This drew the attention of powerful people.

<img src="spawn_fan_art.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="Spawn fan art" />

Jason Wynn, who had long been his superior, discovered this and realized that Al knew way too much. So he paid Chapel, Al's buddy and collaborator, to murder him. Al Simmons was slaughtered in a raging fire, and his soul was consigned to Hell for intentionally killing innocent people while working for the C.I.A.

To see his wife Wanda Fitzgerald again, Al made a bargain to sell his soul to a Demonic Being called as " Malebolgia." He was allowed to return, but he returned five years later as some odd Hellspawn with no memory of what he had done. He sought out his wife after recalling what he had done, only to discover she had gone on and married his best buddy, Terry Fitzgerald, and had a child named Cyan.

Following this, his demonic guide, the Violator, who had the appearance of a clown, emerged. He battled Spawn after telling him what his life's mission was, but Malebolgia intervened to stop the fight. Realizing his purpose at this point, he must battle the forces of Heaven and Hell to survive.

### A Fresh Start

<img src="classic-spawn.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="Classic Spawn" />

Spawn's early fights against gangs and street thugs were quite anti-hero like. Billy Kincaid, a child killer and pedophile, was later brutally murdered by him. Sam Burke and Twitch Williams, a detective team, entered Spawn's life as a result of this deed.

Later, the Angel Angela who hunted Spawns for sport pursued him.

Around this time, Spawn ascends to the position of "king" in "Rat City," a collection of alleys where vagrants and the homeless reside. He runs across the loser Cogliostro there, who surprises Spawn by knowing a lot about him.

Overtkill, a cyborg mafia enforcer, would eventually face off against Spawn, who managed to survive and prevail. Angela was after him once more, and he would battle Jason Wynn, an angelic warrior known as the Anti-Spawn or the Redeemer.

### The Initial Transformation

<img src="spawn_first_metamorphosis.jpg" width="250" align="left" alt="First metamorphoses" />

Spawn's suit evolved after a close call with a Redeemer and became more sophisticated. The strange cape developed a small tear, the red glow from the costume had vanished, and it had changed to what is now black and white. Spawn discovered that the gloves and boots he used to wear had been modified and replaced with spikes. Spawn's new costume was more potent than the original, and he also learned that his new chains and cape could change into other objects to fool his enemies. Spawn used his swords to slash off a redeemer's hand after learning this.

When Spawn defeated the Redeemer, he believed the conflict was ended, but then he encountered the Freak, a more potent opponent than the Redeemer. While fighting The Freak, Spawn was not aware of The Freak's ability to cause nightmares, which he used to torture Spawn with memories of his past. A being fighting other beings and creatures during the conflict defeats Spawn while resembling him in appearance. When Spawn awoke, the creature informed him that the suit would now consume souls as a means of sustenance. This Spawn subsequently finds himself in New York City after being informed. He would battle The Curse, meet Harry Houdini, who would teach him magic, and he would also run into Batman.

Following this, Tony Twist sends Overtkill, who has been reprogrammed, after Terry, accusing him of being responsible for the latest mob attacks, forcing Spawn to confess his identity in order to save his friend. Twitch Williams' skillfully placed shot, though, was what ultimately brought Overtkill down this time. Later on, after Bobby was killed in another altercation with Chapel, he would bring Bobby back. In addition to taking part in Angela's trial, Spawn subsequently visited the South where he ran across the KKK and a violent father of twin sons. A fresh Redeemer assaulted him when he got back to New York. As a result, his costume changed, and when it gained power, it defeated the Redeemer.

### Greenworld and Urizen

Spawn started to lose himself to evil because to the escalating attacks from Heaven and Hell, but with the help of The Heap, he was able to reclaim his objective. The Heap was a representative of the Greenworld, a dimension with power comparable to both Heaven and Hell, which did not care about their conflict but wished to halt the damage it was causing. Spawn was given additional abilities so he could comprehend the planet and its inhabitants better.

### The Newest Devil King

Spawn discovers after his struggle that Malebolgia arranged Urizen's release in order to initiate Armageddon and conquer the forces of Hell because his army was larger at the time. Spawn and Angela resolved to go to Hell and murder him to put an end to his plans. Angela mortally wounds Malebolgia during the conflict, but he kills her with his remaining strength, and Spawn slashes off his head in rage.

### Hell and Heaven

<img src="angel_spawn.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="Angel Spawn" />

As Spawn fought to discover a means to free himself from Hell's grasp and reclaim power, he noticed that the attacks came from both Heaven and Hell. Spawn initially lost the battle due to the Salvation, who had appeared in a new form, The Heap, a creature from the green realm and one of Spawn's weaknesses. Heap's power was equal to Heaven and Hell, something Spawn had never faced before, because it granted him new abilities that allowed him to defeat the worst of both Heaven and Hell.

Though these abilities were not fully understood, they appear to grant control over all of the world's elements. It was claimed that the Greenworld had no interest in the war between Heaven and Hell, but was frustrated by the havoc it caused. They caused the earth's anguish, and Spawn became aware of it afterwards. Spawn, instead of listening to Earth, did not adjust his powers until he was attacked by Urizen. After recuperating, Spawn discovers that the Greenworld bestowed upon him a gift, which he utilizes to contain Urizen by separating the earth and imprisoning him within it.

After killing him, he discovers that the throne of Hell is rightfully his, and it is offered to him by the demon Mammon; however, he declines the offer; however, after deliberating with his teacher Cog, he decides to turn Hell into a new paradise; however, Cog reveals that he is Cain, the man who murdered his brother in envy, and the first murderer and man to go to Hell. His true goal has been to conquer Hell, and he employs Hellspawn to accomplish this. He betrayed Spawn and usurped the throne, but he returned the gift of his human form to him.

### Wandering

When he returns, he meets Nyx, a young Wiccan. He regains his suit with her assistance, but he has lost much of his power due to the fact that he is still human without the suit. Mammon, on the other hand, dupes and betrays Nyx, seizing control of Spawn's union with his suit and erasing all of his memories of the past. He wanders the Earth with no memory, releasing a group of angels known as the Forgotten, who take no sides in the war between Heaven and Hell. He discovers that Mammon is a Fallen member who was sent to Hell, and that his power is far greater than Malebolgia's.

### Armageddon

<img src="spawn_armageddon.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="Spawn Armageddon" />

Spawn's memories are restored thanks to the Greenworld's power. His suit evolves once more, and it now appears to be one with his body, but as time passes, he begins to despise himself. Heaven and hell have both rejected him, and he now sits in back alleys and city streets, perched on a stage prop in an abandoned warehouse, as maggots and other dreadful insects crawl inside his body. Where is he to go, nesting inside the empty shell that he has become? His first thought is to return to the dead zone, but that is heaven's territory... and a Hellspawn is not welcome there. As soon as he enters, Spawn is met by the Disciple, who greets him by taking out his brain and throwing his heart into the Greenworld while casting Spawn's corpse to hell. Mammon then kidnaps Spawn and uses torture to get a better understanding of the secrets he is hiding.

Meanwhile, when Spawn's heart fell to the Green World, a soul was liberated, as all souls who died within an hour of Al's death were absorbed into the Spawn suit (thus why Malebolgia could not control Spawn). Chris visits his mother once more, as instructed by the Man of Miracles, and then travels to hell with Sam Burke and Twitch Williams to save Spawn from Mammon. When Spawn returns to Earth, Signs of Armageddon begin to appear, and he begins to look for a way to stop it. Spawn discovers that Wanda's twin children are to blame and prevents them from murdering their entire family, but he is unable to destroy them. Jake is God, and Katie is Satan, according to Zera.

<img src="spawn_armageddon_2.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="Spawn Armageddon" />

Spawn discovers that the Mother stripped them of their powers and positions and exiled them to Earth because of their hatefulness for one another and constant fighting. She tells him that while he cannot prevent Armageddon, he has the potential to be elevated to the level of a God and thus save the human race.

To gain such power, he must consume a piece of Forbidden Fruit from the Garden of Eden. She tells Spawn that he must first prove himself by fighting The Disciple. It is revealed that there are twelve disciples, each representing a disciple of Jesus. His power is also diminished because a demon is not permitted to enter the Garden, and it has taken the form of a counter beginning at 9:9:9:9. However, with Cyan's help, he defeats all of the Disciples except the last Judas, whom Cyan tells him not to kill. He then stabs him in the heart, but the Mother saves him by giving him a piece of the fruit. He takes on a more angelic appearance and gains more power.

When he returns to Earth, it has been destroyed by the four Horsemen, with all humans dead and Angels and Demons in their place, ready to fight in the final battle. After defeating Zera, he discovers the bodies of Heaven's warriors, one of whom is Granny Blake, who has been betrayed by her faith. Spawn then goes up against Satan and God's forces. He employs all of the power bestowed upon him by the Mother to destroy the forces of Heaven and Hell, as well as all of humanity. He prevents Armageddon by removing their armies; he is then killed by the two, who fight alone on Earth.

### New Clown

Spawn, on the other hand, returns and, by surrendering to the Mother's power, resurrects everyone with knowledge of what happened. He shut the doors to Heaven, Hell, and Earth, leaving God and Satan to fight in their own worlds. He asked the mother to turn him back into a human, but he later asked to be turned back into a Hellspawn.

<img src="violator.jpg" width="250" align="right" alt="The New Clown" />

After a string of strange murders, Spawn discovers that the Clown has resurfaced in the body of a man named Barney Saunders. It was revealed that Saunders was having an affair with Wilma Barbara and became trapped in a garbage chute while trying to flee her husband. He stayed for a while until Spawn destroyed and rebuilt the world. Clown rescued him so he could use his body for himself. He then summoned the dark urges within the tenants of an apartment building and used them to construct a portal to Hell in order to resurrect his brother. However, before he could create a portal, Wilma appeared, and his love for her allowed Saunders to reclaim control. He then intended to close the portal by passing through it, but Wilma accompanied him because he was upset about her abandoning him in the chute.

Zera reappeared, but only her head remained, and she was imprisoned in a jar. Mambo Suzanne, a Voodoo priestess, summoned Spawn. Zera was attempting to take over Nyx's body and fight Spawn when Suzanne used their fight as a distraction and threw her head into the streets, where it was devoured by demon dogs. Nyx was set free, and she and Spawn rekindled their friendship.

Later, Spawn discovered that Ab and Zab had founded a hellish asylum where demons known as sin eaters would conjure up visions of people's worst transgressions in order to prey on their guilt. After killing the most of the sin eaters, he discovered that his brother Richard was being fed on by a minister, so he caused him to have hallucinations.

It was revealed that Mammon had known Al as Mr. Malefick when he was younger. Al was taught to kill tiny animals in an effort to convert him into a killer, and he also forced Richard to use narcotics. Only their brother Marc was immune to Mammon's spell. After becoming high and stabbing his drug supplier Weasel later, Richard phoned his brothers for assistance. Al kills Weasel instead of being accused of the crime, and Mammon buries the body.

Nyx and Spawn then kill the last sin eater, and Spawn discovers that Richard is unable to recall his parents due to a spell cast by Mammon, and Spawn goes to find out more about them. He discovers their home is under a Mammon-placed spell that has kept them there for years. His mother is not surprised by his appearance, but his father is. It was revealed that his mother and Mammon had intended to produce a hellspawn that was more powerful than the others, but his father was devastated that he had been powerless to stop her. His father then gives him a journal that his mother had forbidden him from seeing. It was revealed that his ancestor came across a hellspawn known as the Gunslinger Spawn in the past.
