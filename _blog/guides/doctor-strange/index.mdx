Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D., also known as Doctor Strange, was Earth-616's Sorcerer Supreme. Strange was a competent but egotistical neurosurgeon until a car accident left his hands paralyzed. When modern treatment failed him, he traveled to Kamar-Taj in Tibet to be trained by the Ancient One. He repaired his hands and studied Magic, ultimately becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts. He settled in Greenwich Village, New York City, and became the Earth's guardian against any otherworldly threats.

In this guide we will help you to truly understand Doctor Strange's history and at the end of this post, we will provide a reading order.

## Story

### Early Life

In November 1930, while Eugene and Beverly Strange were on vacation in Philadelphia, Stephen Strange was born. Donna, Stephen's sister, was born at the homestead in Nebraska in 1932. Knowing that Strange would succeed as Sorcerer Supreme, a jealous apprentice sorcerer named Karl Mordo plagued the young boy with demons from the time he was eight years old until he reached maturity. In the end, Strange was saved by Mordo's lord, the Ancient One, who at the time was the Sorcerer Supreme and a magical defender of the Earth-realm. Victor, Stephen's sibling, was born not long after this suffering started. When Strange was eleven years old, he helped a hurt Donna, which ultimately sparked his interest in medicine.

He had a brief romance with Laura Robson when he was fifteen. Straight out of high school, Strange enrolled at New York College as a pre-med student. Later, while on his birthday vacation at home, Strange was swimming with Donna when she had a cramp. Stephen finally discovered her already drowned after a frantic search. He felt personally unsuccessful as a result of the incident, which damaged his medical idealism.

### Medical Career

Deciding that the only way to stop Mordo was to learn magic himself in order to challenge Mordo on his terms, Strange accepted the Ancient One's offer.Pleased by Strange's acceptance for unselfish reasons, the Ancient One removed the mystic restraints, explaining that he was well aware of Mordo's treachery but preferred to keep Mordo close by in order to control and possibly change him. The Ancient One had known of Strange and his potential to serve as the Sorcerer Supreme prior to even Strangeâ€™s first encounter with him. He regarded his hidden prowess so highly that he rejected Daimon Hellstrom for Strange as his pupil. The Ancient One had planned to make Dr. Strange his successor for a long time.

### Car Crash

<img src="car-crash.webp" width="250" align="left" alt="Car crash" />

Strange was in a car accident that left him paralyzed around 1963. Dr. Nicodemus West, a brilliant surgeon in his own right and a fan of Dr. Stephen Strange, agreed to perform the operation. Though he was able to save Strange, his hands' nerves were severely damaged. Dr. Strange, whose surgical career had ended and who was too vain to accept positions as a consultant or assistant, quickly spent his fortune on every rumored treatment, no matter how ineffective. In a matter of months, the once wealthy surgeon had become a destitute, resorting to a variety of shady medical procedures to survive. About the years, Strange's remorse over his youthful transgressions would come to dominate him, and his memories of the past weren't always reliable.

### The Ancient One

Strange pawned his final things to buy a passage to the East after learning about the legendary Ancient One. When Strange discovered the Ancient One's Tibetan palace, the veteran sorcerer offered to teach Strange mysticism rather than heal him. Strange refused, but a severe snowfall prevented him from leaving right away. The Ancient One's student, Baron Mordo, sneakily attacked the teacher with mystically created skeletons, but the old man was easily able to dismiss them while Strange stayed for the remainder of the storm. Strange confronted Mordo about the betrayal as his doubts started to fade, but Mordo countered with restraining spells that prevented Strange from alerting the Ancient One or physically harming Mordo. These magical feats astound Strange, who had a change of heart.

Strange accepted the Ancient One's offer, deciding that the only way to defeat Mordo was for him to master magic and fight Mordo on his terms. The Ancient One released the mystic constraints after being pleased by Strange's acceptance for Strange's sake and stating that he was well aware of Mordo's betrayal but preferred to keep Mordo close by in order to control and potentially transform him. Even before Strange first met the Ancient One, he was aware of Strange and his capacity to act as the Sorcerer Supreme. Daimon Hellstrom was passed up for Strange as a student because he held Daimon in such high regard for his concealed prowess. For a very long time, The Ancient One had intended for Dr. Strange to be his successor.

Strange spent years learning under the Ancient One's guidance how to summon the energies of Principalities, strong beings like Dormammu, Satannish, and the Vishanti who lived in their own mystic realms, as well as how to use the intrinsic mystic abilities of both himself and the world around him. Mordo fled the Ancient One's palace a few years after Strange's arrival in order to pursue greater power. In the future, the two rivals would frequently face off. Strange succeeded in a test against Death itself during this time. Strange received an ankh-shaped mark on his forehead that would only surface when his life was in grave danger as well as an ageless life.

By completing this test over 600 years ago, the Ancient One had achieved nigh immortality. Strange made friends with numerous sorcerers while still a young student of the mystic arts, including Lord Julian Phyffe and Sir Clive Bentley from Britain, Cardinal Alfeo Spinosa and Count Tancredo Carezzi from Italy, Omar Karindu, Rama Kaliph, and Turhan Barim from the Middle East, Wai Chee Yee and Sen-Yu from Asia, Aleister Kane, Kenneth Ward, and Frank Brukner from America. Strange also made friends with additional earthling heroes, helping the Black Fox in at least two quests while other explorers, such Immortalis and Terror, Inc., were skeptical of him.

### Super Hero Career

<img src="doctor-strange-as-superhero.jfif" width="250" align="left" alt="Doctor Strange as Superhero" />

Strange initially kept his distance from New York's superhero community, fighting his fights against Nightmare and Baron Mordo in secrecy as the Fantastic Four's appearance signaled the beginning of the Heroic Age. At one point, Strange was tricked into attacking his brave foster brother, Thor, by the Asgardian God of deceit, Loki. But as soon as the plot was made public, Strange turned against Loki. After another confrontation with Mordo, Thor would later intervene on Strange as Dr. Donald Blake to save his life. Soon after, Strange teamed up with the youthful Spider-Man during a battle with Mordo, and together they helped Strange rescue several individuals from a strange dimension.

Since the incident was so horrific, Spider-Man begged Doctor Strange to erase their memories of it; however, this also made them forget Spider-bravery. Man's Strange grew to respect the young hero as a friend after being moved by his bravery and selflessness, and the two have collaborated on numerous occasions over the years. Sensing the waning strength of his longtime foe, the Ancient One, the Dread Dormammu threatened to invade the Earth-Realm and despatched a message in advance. The Ancient One sent Strange to the Dark Dimension to fight Dormammu after learning of the villain's plans. While there, Clea, a novice mystic and, though few at the time knew it, the child of Dormammu's sibling Umar, approached Strange.

If Dormammu were to lose control of the Dark Dimension, Clea feared that the spatial walls would deteriorate and the Mindless Ones would devastate the realm. Clea attempted to stop the duel in this way, but Strange was unyielding. Strange was easily defeated by Dormammu, but in the process, he lost just enough of his energy to allow the Mindless Ones to intrude. Strange gave Dormammu the ability to construct a new barrier in order to protect the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension. Angered by his own frailty, Dormammu was compelled by his sense of honor to save Strange, who in turn pleaded with him to save the Earth-Realm and the alluring Clea. Later, Clea helped Strange once more from a distance and was once more imprisoned by Dormammu.

He made her watch as Strange and Mordo sparred, with Strange absorbing a number of blows from his opponent before the tides finally turned and Strange came dangerously near to defeating Mordo. Dormammu made the decision to engage in combat himself out of concern that his puppet would fail. Strange was able to prevail in the battle despite the numerous obstacles, but once Dormammu left the Dark Dimension, he got in touch with Strange and forced him watch as Clea was exiled. As time passed, Clea was saved, and Eternity defeated Dormammu, leaving the Dark Dimension without a ruler. Soon after, Strange joined a number of other superheroes in a conflict with the potent mutant Sundown.

He became a special consultant to well-known super-teams including the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and the Avengers as he became increasingly active in the superhero community. Doctor Strange had to save Clea once more because Umar had cast her to another dimension in an attempt to lure Strange to beat him months after witnessing Reed and Sue Richards' wedding. After escaping from numerous of Umar's traps and saving Clea, Strange was forced to watch as she was whisked away from him once more after the Ancient One persuaded him that the only way she would be safe was if she was sent to another dimension yet again.

<img src="the-undying-ones.webp" width="250" align="left" alt="The Undying Ones" />

Strange kept the new look after beating Asmodeus in order to maintain his anonymity. The cosmic Eternity, who Strange was assisting at the time, decided to restore Strange's anonymity after he carelessly revealed his name during a confrontation with Nightmare. To do this, they changed all pertinent records and memories bearing the name "Stephen Strange" to "Stephen Sanders." The Undying Ones, a race of demons that once ruled the Earth and were led by the diabolical Nameless One, were the next threat that Strange resisted. Strange coerced the gigantic Hulk and Prince Namor of Atlantis into helping him defend against the assault. Strange seems to believe that the earth was now safe from further invasion after the Undying Ones were vanquished.

Despite their differences, the three quickly grew close and the alien Silver Surfer joined them to form the nucleus of the Defenders, a loosely-knit "non-team" that would occasionally come together to combat threats to the Earth.
