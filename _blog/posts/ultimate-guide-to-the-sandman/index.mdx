Fans of Netflix's The Sandman series may be left wanting more after seeing the 10th episode because one of the greatest comics of all time has finally been adapted for the big screen. Fortunately, there are lots of comics available that can fill that gap!

## Table of Contents

## The Sandman in Comics

The original comic by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg continues to inspire writers today, and of course, it's always worthwhile to reread the best parts of the first run.

In the tenth episode's closing minutes, we catch up with Lucifer, who is still furious with Morpheus for degrading her during his earlier visit to Hell. The tale will pick up there, with Lucifer exacting her vengeance, if and when the streamer formally orders The Sandman for season 2.

But you can read the original content right now if you want to get a head start! Season 2 of The Sandman would likely focus on volume 4, Season of Mists, a notable arc in one of the most famous comic sagas ever published, just as season 1 adapted the first two volumes of the comic (Preludes & Nocturnes and The Doll's House).

## What is Sandman

![The Sandman in Comic and Netflix's Series](the_sandman_movie_and_comic.webp)

It's challenging to sum up! Neil Gaiman, the creator of the series, responded, "The Lord of Dreams learns that one must change or die, and makes his decision," when asked to sum up Sandman in fewer than 25 words. Which, while pithy and poetic, is not all that useful. So allow me to elaborate a bit further.

The Dream, the personification of all dreams and stories, is the subject of The Sandman's tale. He can make himself look like just about anything, but his typical appearance is that of a pale, depressed man with dark eyes and unkempt hair. The Dream is captured and imprisoned by a group of black magic occultists in 1916, marking the beginning of the story.

Dream flees in 1988, the year Gaiman started working on the series, and he spends the subsequent issues attempting to retake control of the realm of Dreaming and his former superpowers. After that tale is over, The Sandman leaps through time and space, following Dream as he goes about doing his job, which is to supervise and control the dreaming, storytelling, and inspiration for all creatures.

Although Sandman is a rather complex plot, it doesn't demand that you immediately understand what it is doing. Sandman will make sure you comprehend anything you need to grasp.

### Where to Start?

Preludes and Nocturnes are a good place to start if you're ready to dive headfirst into the world of The Sandman. It opens with Dream's decades-long imprisonment—a crucial plot event with repercussions that carry through to the series' conclusion—and follows his release and his unsuccessful struggle to restore his powers in a straightforward, gratifying manner.

It's also important to notice that The Sandman as a whole has a weak beginning. Additionally, the main story, which follows Dream's rather simple mission to retrieve three magical trinkets, feels a little forced and video game-like.

The entire scope of Sandman's narrative ambition is only revealed in later volumes, so if Preludes & Nocturnes left you feeling a little dissatisfied, I'd recommend reading The Doll's House before deciding how you feel. There is yet one more possibility to take into account if you're looking for a sensible Sandman beginning place.

A six-issue limited series titled Sandman: Overture by Neil Gaiman saw Gaiman return to the Sandman universe in 2013. In this cosmic tale, which takes place before the events of Preludes & Nocturnes, Gaiman explains how Dream was weakened to the point where a group of occultists could trap him in the first place.

### What to Expect?

Throughout its 75-issue run, The Sandman generally alternated between lengthy narrative arcs and standalone stories. The Dream is the major character in the narrative, and he frequently occupies the heart of the comic book's most well-known and lauded tales. Although Dream is frequently a supporting character, The Sandman delights in how swiftly and surprisingly it creates the world around him.

At his most inventive, Gaiman also discovers methods to incorporate historical facts into the plot of the comic book, as shown in the World Fantasy Award-winning issue that creates a new backstory for Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Along the way, The Sandman also incorporates a ton of fictional people and places, such as an early tale that is partially set at Arkham Asylum, which is also where the majority of Batman's supervillains wind up.

### The Doll's House

An older guy in the desert tells a younger man an old tale about the sad love between Dream and Queen Nada as part of a manhood ceremony. Nada rejects Dream out of concern for the repercussions of loving an eternal. Nada is thrown to Hell by Dream as a result of his rage, where she is still present.

Desire, Dream's sibling, contacts Despair, Dream's twin, to let her know that a new dream vortex has formed. The two of them hint at a plan to harm Dream.

### Dream Country

<img src="the_sandman_dream_country.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: Dream Country" />

This is the tale of a dissatisfied novelist named Richard Madoc, whose first book has received excellent reviews but whose promised sequel has yet to see the light of day. He forms a bargain with an established author named Erasmus Fry for the Greek mythological Muse Calliope, whom Fry had previously in his life caught in return for a bezoar. She was repeatedly raped by Fry while she was imprisoned, and her presence served as the basis for several of his well-read works.

### Season of Mists

<img src="the_sandman_season_of_mists.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: Season of Mists" />

Season of Mists collects issues #21-28 of The Sandman. The fourth collection, like the first, is possibly one of the two most centered on Morpheus himself.

It starts off with an Endless family gathering before quickly transitioning into an Endless family quarrel. Morpheus is enraged when Desire taunts him about his intolerant treatment of a former lover, the narrative of whom forms the preface to the second book, The Doll's House. Morpheus is further infuriated by Death's agreement with Desire, but because of his profound regard for Death, he takes her opinion more seriously than he would have with Desire. He eventually yields to her knowledge on the subject.

### A Game of You

<img src="the_sandman_a_game_of_you.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: A Game of You" />

Barbie is the key character of A Game of You, introduced as a resident of the house where Rose Walker stayed during the events of The Doll's House, when Barbie fantasized of herself as a princess of a fantasy realm. As A Game of You begins, Barbie, who is no longer a dreamer, lives in an apartment building with her best friend Wanda, the lesbian couple Hazel McNamara and Foxglove, the sorceress Thessaly, a quiet man named George, and several other characters.

### Fables and Reflections

<img src="the_sandman_fables_and_reflections.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: Fables and Reflections" />

The issues of The Sandman from #29 to #31, #38 to #40, #50, the Sandman Special Song of Orpheus, and the Vertigo Preview "Fear of Falling" make up Fables and Reflections. Unlike the other volumes, it collects nonlinear groups of issue arcs and one-shots.

<ReadingOrderIssue name="Fables and Reflections - The Sandman" hrefTemplate="/comic/the-sandman-1989/issue-" start={29} end={31} />

### Brief Lives

<img src="the_sandman_brief_lives.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: Brief Lives" />

The main theme of the narrative is Delirium's desire for peace with her brother Destruction. In order to accomplish this, she initially approaches Desire and Despair, both of whom decline to join her on her journey, before ultimately persuading Dream. Her list states that they consult persons who are familiar with Destruction, but every time they do, they are killed, sent into hiding, or otherwise destroyed.

<ReadingOrderIssue name="Brief Lives" hrefTemplate="/comic/the-sandman-1989/issue-" start={41} end={49} />

### World's End

<img src="the_sandman_worlds_end.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: World's End" />

Worlds' End, like volumes 3 and 6, Dream Country and Fables and Reflections, is a collection of mostly single-issue short stories that are only tangentially tied to the series' main story. The issues of Worlds' End were written and released in chronological order, with a frame narrative.

On their way to Chicago, Brant Tucker and his coworker Charlene Mooney are engaged in a car accident that starts the narrative in the first person. A hedgehog points Brant in the direction of a weird inn called "Worlds' End, a free house," which is subsequently revealed to be one of four inns where travelers between realms seek refuge during reality storms, which happen after significant events.

### The Kindly Ones

<img src="the_sandman_the_kindly_ones.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: The Kindly Ones" />

The Kindly Ones, which wraps up a tale that mostly started in the second collection The Doll's House and the seventh collection's Brief Lives, belongs with those two collections. It also contains elements from Season of Mists and the tale of Orpheus, which is primarily told in Fables and Reflections.

The Kindly Ones, which is the most structurally complex of the volumes, is a single narrative written as a Greek tragedy, with Morpheus serving as its tragic hero and one of the witches from the trio, the Erinyes, serving as the Greek chorus. It ties up several loose ends from the series, including the animosities harbored for Morpheus by several characters, including Hippolyta Hall, the witches themselves, the Norse god Loki, and the witch Thessaly. The Kindly Ones also continues the tales of the Corinthian, Rose Walker, and her previous landlord Hal, as well as Cluracan of Faerie and his sister Nuala.

### The Wake

<img src="the_sandman_the_wake.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="Cover of The Sandman: The Wake" />

The wake and funeral for Morpheus, who passes away after the ninth collection, The Kindly Ones, are covered in the first three chapters of the volume, "Chapter One, Which Occurs in the Wake of What Has Gone Before," "Chapter Two, In Which a Wake is Held," and "Chapter Three, In Which We Wake." "Dreamers and guests," "celebrities and mourners" attend; many of them have appeared frequently in the earlier volumes. A number of speakers, including Death as the final one, offer their thoughts on the life and demise of the late Dream King. Daniel the child has since grown up and is now the new facet of Dream, who begins interacting with the Dreaming's residents.
